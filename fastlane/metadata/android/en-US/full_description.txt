Off Grid is a complete offline AI suite that runs entirely on your phone. No cloud, no accounts, no tracking — everything stays on your device.

Most "local LLM" apps give you a text chatbot and call it a day. Off Grid brings text generation, image generation, vision AI, voice transcription, and document analysis together in one app, all running natively on your phone's hardware.
